# Defining VLANs

Since most modern managed switches work in terms of VLANs, it is documented here
how a VLAN is configured.

In this example, we define the following VLANs:
* `corp` with VLAN ID 131
* `outside` with VLAN ID 242
* `dmz` with VLAN ID 464

Additionally, we configure a VLAN `test` with VLAN ID 353 and remove it
immediately thereafter.
